# PhoneCarte

Frontend demo of my e-commerce listing called 'PhoneCarte', with capability for selected items to be added to cart and remove from cart using reactjs. Below are the features currently being implemented. 

  - filter and list only items that are marked as published
  - add to cart and remove from items list
  - remove from cart and add back to items list


### Tech

PhoneCarte uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) - Component based javasript via create-react-app boilerplate
* [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) - Boilerplate for the react structure 
* [jest](https://jestjs.io/) - testing framework used in this app

### Development

PhoneCarte requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install or yarn install
$ npm start or yarn start
```

### Running Tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

### Todos

 - Write more tests
 - Display more details to show in detail page
 - Add animation
 - Add real API backend using node or graphql and apollo
